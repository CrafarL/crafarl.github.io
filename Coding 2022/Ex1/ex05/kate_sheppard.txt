Kate Sheppard
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Sheppard
Katherine Wilson Sheppard (née Catherine Wilson Malcolm; 10 March 1848 – 13 July 1934) was the most prominent member of the women's suffrage movement in New Zealand and the country's most famous suffragist.

Early life
Kate Sheppard was born Catherine Wilson Malcolm on 10 March 1848[a] in Liverpool, England, to Scottish parents Jemima Crawford Souter and Andrew Wilson Malcolm. Her father, born in Scotland in 1819, was described in various documents as either a lawyer, banker, brewer's clerk, or legal clerk; he married Souter in the Inner Hebrides on 14 July 1842.[2] Catherine was named after her paternal grandmother, also Catherine Wilson Malcolm,[2] but preferred to spell her name "Katherine" or to abbreviate it to "Kate".[5]

Women's suffrage movement
Kate Sheppard's activism and engagement with politics began after listening to or reading about a talk by Mary Leavitt from the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) of the United States.[19] In 1885 Leavitt toured New Zealand speaking not only about the problems caused by alcohol consumption, but also the need for women to have a "voice in public affairs".[20] She spent two weeks in Christchurch, starting with a public speech at the Theatre Royal on 10 May.[21] Journalists were impressed by the strength of public speaking displayed by a woman, something not witnessed often at that time in New Zealand.[22][23]

Later life
As editor of The White Ribbon and president of the National Council of Women, Sheppard promoted many ideas related to improving the situation and status of women. In particular, she was concerned about establishing legal and economic independence of women from men.[85] She was not only occupied with advancing women's rights, but also promoted political reforms such as proportional representation, binding referendums, and a Cabinet elected directly by Parliament.[5][86]

Commemoration
Sheppard is considered to be an important figure in New Zealand's history.[8] Since 1991 her profile has featured on the New Zealand ten-dollar note.[105][106][107] A 2005 television show New Zealand's Top 100 History Makers ranked Sheppard as the second most influential New Zealander of all time.[108] Similarly, The New Zealand Herald selected Sheppard as one of their ten greatest New Zealanders in 2013.[109]

In 1972, Patricia Grimshaw's book Women's Suffrage in New Zealand identified Sheppard as the leading figure of the suffrage movement. This was the first acclaimed book to do so and its publication marked a growth in recognition of Kate Sheppard's life and activism.[110]
